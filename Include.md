## Welcome to my application
This application is based on the course project of statistical inference class of the data science specialisation.

In that project, We investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. More specificly, we study the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 exponentially distributed variables with lambda equal to 0.2.

## Input
In this application, we are able to change the number of simulations (e.g. 1000), the number of exponentials we generate in each simulation (e.g. 40), the rate parameter lambda (e.g. 0.2), and the seed we use for randomnisation.

The user can choose whether or not to show the sample mean on the plot.

## Output
- Two plots that show the distribution of the exponentials and the distribution of the means of the exponentials. The latter should be approximately normal.
- Both the theoretical and sample values of the mean and variance of the average of the exponentials, which should be very close.
- Up to user's choice, a red line indicating the sample mean can be shown on the second plot.
